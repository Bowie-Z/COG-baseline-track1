# COG-baseline-track1
This repository is related to the 2022 CoG Robomaster Sim2Real Challenge which is organized by CASIA DRL Team.In this repository, we will provide the competiton environment for you, and you can also find the Instructions of the necessary environment API in test_*. py.            

We recommend using conda to create a virtual environment.  

How to use the code we provided?  

1.We provide two environments for you to use different os(Windows/Linux) to paticipate in this competition.You can get the environment by the baidu network disk:  

a. The Windows version, link:

2. You can install the environment dependent using the command:

        conda env create -f environment_*.yml.  

3. Run the test_*.py, you will see our simulation environment.  
               
Special Noteï¼šthis is our first demo environment, we will update some new version according to the performance of contestants .  
        
When the game officially starts, we will provide the baseline algrithom for you.
