# COG-baseline-track1
This repository is related to the 2022 CoG Robomaster Sim2Real Challenge.In this repository, we will provide our environment for you, and you can also find the Instructions of the necessary environment API in test.py.We recommend using conda to create a virtual environment.

How to use the code we provided?

        1.We provide two environments for you  using different os(Windows/Linux) to paticipate to this competition.You can get the environment by the Baidu network disk:

        a. The Windows version:link：https://pan.baidu.com/s/1r71AoU-iv1KocmMFP7gVWQ  Extraction code：qoy7

        b. The Linux version:link: https://pan.baidu.com/s/1J6STeWEqgsw8m4N28PJWdQ  Extraction code：4i1z

        2. You can install the environment dependent using the command:conda env create -f environment.yml.

        3. Run the test.py, you will see our simulation environment.
        
       
Special Note：this is our first demo environment, we will update some new version according to the performance of contestants .
        
When the game officially starts, we will provide the baseline algrithom for you.
